# Implementation Plan: MCP Server SDK for x402 Payments

## Overview

Build a developer-friendly SDK that simplifies x402 payment integration for MCP servers. Extract and abstract the complexity from the current `packages/shared/` implementation into a clean, decorator-based API.

- [ ] Create TypeScript definitions for all public APIs
- [ ] Build configuration system with environment detection
- [ ] Add basic error handling and logging
- [ ] Create simple integration test suite

### Deliverables
- [ ] Working `@nanda/mcp-server-sdk` package
- [ ] TypeScript decorators for payment requirements
- [ ] Automatic HTTP 402 response generation
- [ ] Basic documentation with getting started guide

- [ ] Add development vs production configuration modes
- [ ] Build example projects demonstrating common patterns
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide and FAQ

### Deliverables
- [ ] CLI scaffolding tool
- [ ] Testing utility functions
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation site
- [ ] 3-5 example projects showing different use cases
- [ ] Developer troubleshooting guide

### Estimated Time: 2-3 days

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 days)

### Goal
Add advanced features for production use and complex scenarios.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement dynamic pricing strategies
- [ ] Add payment analytics and monitoring hooks
- [ ] Create advanced error handling with retry logic
- [ ] Build payment caching and optimization
- [ ] Add support for multiple pricing tiers
- [ ] Implement webhook support for payment events
- [ ] Create performance monitoring utilities
- [ ] Add production deployment guides

### Deliverables
- [ ] Dynamic pricing API
- [ ] Analytics integration hooks
- [ ] Production-ready error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization features
- [ ] Deployment documentation

### Estimated Time: 2-3 days

## Technical Architecture

### Package Structure
```
packages/mcp-server-sdk/
├── src/
│   ├── decorators/          # @requiresPayment decorator
│   ├── middleware/          # Express middleware adapters
│   ├── config/              # Configuration management
│   ├── testing/             # Test utilities
│   ├── cli/                 # CLI scaffolding tools
│   └── types/               # TypeScript definitions
├── examples/                # Integration examples
├── docs/                    # Documentation
└── tests/                   # Test suites
```

### Core API Design
```typescript
// Simple static pricing
@requiresPayment({ price: 10, description: "AI analysis" })
app.get('/analyze', handler);

// Dynamic pricing
@requiresPayment((req) => ({
  price: calculatePrice(req.body),
  description: "Custom analysis"
}))
app.post('/custom', handler);

// Configuration
configurePayments({
  facilitatorUrl: "http://localhost:3001",
  defaultRecipient: "my-service"
});
```

### Dependencies Strategy
- Minimize external dependencies
- Reuse battle-tested code from `packages/shared/`
- Ensure compatibility with Express.js primarily
- Abstract framework-specific code for future expansion

## Integration with Existing Code

### Extract from Current Implementation
- Payment middleware logic from `packages/shared/src/middleware.ts`
- Type definitions from `packages/shared/src/types.ts`
- MongoDB utilities from `packages/shared/src/mongodb.ts`
- NANDA Points scheme from `packages/shared/src/nanda-points-scheme.ts`

### Simplify and Abstract
- Hide x402 protocol complexity behind decorators
- Automatic facilitator URL discovery and configuration
- Sensible defaults for development and production
- Clear error messages for common developer mistakes

### Maintain Compatibility
- Use same facilitator API endpoints
- Maintain compatibility with existing NANDA Points system
- Support existing MongoDB schema and transaction patterns

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Decorator functionality and metadata extraction
- Configuration parsing and validation
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end payment flows
- HTTP 402 response validation
- Database transaction verification

### Developer Testing
- Mock payment client utilities
- Test payment payload generators
- Facilitator interaction mocking

## Documentation Strategy

### Getting Started Guide
- 5-minute quick start tutorial
- Common use case examples
- Troubleshooting common issues

### API Reference
- Complete TypeScript API documentation
- All decorator options and configurations
- Error codes and handling

### Integration Examples
- Express.js integration
- Next.js API routes
- Fastify integration
- Custom framework examples

## Quality Gates

### Phase 1 Requirements
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Basic integration test suite passing
- [ ] Getting started guide complete

### Phase 2 Requirements
- [ ] CLI tool functional
- [ ] All example projects working
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Developer feedback incorporated

### Phase 3 Requirements
- [ ] Production deployment tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Advanced feature documentation complete
- [ ] Security review completed

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Decorator complexity**: Start with simple implementation, expand gradually
- **Framework compatibility**: Begin with Express.js, abstract later
- **Performance overhead**: Profile and optimize during Phase 3

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning curve**: Extensive examples and documentation
- **Migration complexity**: Provide migration tools and guides
- **Feature gaps**: Regular developer feedback collection

## Success Metrics

- **Time to first payment**: < 10 minutes from npm install
- **Code reduction**: 80% less boilerplate vs manual implementation
- **Error rate**: < 5% of developers encounter setup issues
- **Adoption rate**: Track npm downloads and GitHub usage

## Notes

This SDK will serve as the primary way developers integrate NANDA Points payments into their MCP servers. It should feel as natural as adding any other Express middleware but with the power of the full x402 payment protocol.

Focus on developer experience above all else - if it's not simple enough for a developer to add payments in under 10 minutes, we haven't succeeded.
