# Implementation Plan: x402 Compliance

## Overview
Complete rebuild implementation plan for x402-compliant **server-side infrastructure**. Will study x402-mcp (client) to understand protocol, then build server-side components. Create monorepo with facilitator service and Resource Server SDK using Streamable HTTP transport. NO code retention from existing implementation.

## Phase 1: Analysis & Setup
**Goal**: Understand x402 protocol and design server-side infrastructure

### Tasks
- [ ] Study x402-mcp (client) to understand expected server behavior
- [ ] Research x402 HTTP 402 response format specification
- [ ] Document what HTTP 402 responses should look like
- [ ] Map NP payment scheme requirements for server-side
- [ ] Document facilitator API interface that servers should provide
- [ ] Design server-side monorepo structure (facilitator + MCP server SDK)
- [ ] Create complete rebuild plan - NO existing code retention
- [ ] Identify Streamable HTTP transport requirements for MCP servers

**Deliverables**:
- x402 protocol analysis (from studying client behavior)
- HTTP 402 response format specification
- Server-side architecture design document
- Monorepo structure design
- NP payment scheme specification
- Complete rebuild specification

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

## Phase 2: Core Implementation
**Goal**: Implement NP payment scheme and facilitator logic

### Tasks
- [ ] Delete all existing implementation files

- [ ] Integrate with MongoDB (retain data, new schema if needed)
- [ ] Update payment requirements format for NP
- [ ] Create Resource Server SDK package
- [ ] Implement facilitator URL inclusion in HTTP 402 responses
- [ ] Ensure Streamable HTTP transport throughout

**Deliverables**:
- Complete monorepo structure
- Working NP payment scheme
- Facilitator API implementation

**Deliverables**:
- Updated MCP server with x402 compliance
- Working payment flow
- Header-based payment processing

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing of x402 compliance

- [ ] Create test suite for x402 protocol compliance
- [ ] Test with standard x402 clients
- [ ] Verify Claude Web integration via ngrok
- [ ] Performance testing with payment flows
- [ ] Error handling and edge case testing
- [ ] Lint and type checking validation

**Deliverables**:

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

## Phase 5: Documentation & Cleanup
**Goal**: Complete documentation and remove legacy code

### Tasks
- [ ] Write new README.md from scratch
- [ ] Document NP payment scheme specification
- [ ] Create API documentation for facilitator endpoints
- [ ] Add usage examples and integration guide
- [ ] Remove old x402-NP implementation files
- [ ] Update package.json and dependencies

**Deliverables**:
- Complete project documentation
- Clean codebase without legacy components
- Usage examples and guides

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

## Current Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Analysis & Setup - COMPLETE
- [x] PRD created and updated with server-side focus
- [x] Implementation plan defined and corrected
- [x] Feature branch established
- [x] Studied Coinbase x402-mcp documentation (client-side)
- [x] Analyzed Coinbase MCP example (also client-side)
- [x] Researched x402 HTTP 402 response format specification
- [x] Confirmed our server-side approach is correct and will be compatible with existing clients
- [x] Designed monorepo structure
- [x] Created base README with architecture and quick start

### ðŸš§ Phase 2: Core Implementation - STARTING
- [ ] **Next**: Delete existing implementation files and create monorepo structure

## HTTP 402 Response Format (from x402 spec)
```json
{
  "paymentRequirements": [{
    "scheme": "string",
    "network": "string",
    "maxAmountRequired": "uint256 as string",
    "resource": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "mimeType": "string",
    "outputSchema": "object | null",
    "payTo": "string",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": "number",
    "asset": "string",
    "extra": "object | null"
  }]
}
```

## Risks & Blockers
- **x402-mcp complexity**: May require more analysis time
- **HTTP layer changes**: Could impact MCP client compatibility
- **Payment verification**: Edge cases in NP transaction validation

## Notes
- Focus on x402 spec compliance over custom features
- Document any deviations with clear reasoning
- Maintain clean commit history throughout implementation
